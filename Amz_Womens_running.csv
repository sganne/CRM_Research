Visually they're nice and not bulky. Size I think is about right. The one thing I can't take is the tongue of the shoe is so stiff and it's attached to the upper so you can't move it like a typical shoe tongue.  It cuts into my shin/ankle and I can't take it. I even wore high socks which looked bad. I would not run in these but for day to day errands they would work if the tongue wasn't so stiff.

I will request a refund because they are tight and flat. I need more support for my hills. Wearing them at home for just 20 minutes gave me pain in my lower back. I gave 4 stars for quality material, but not for the fit and comfort."

I'm considering getting another pair to be running around, every day shoes b/c wearing your gross nursing shoes outside the hospital...yuck!  My ONLY complaint about the shoes are that the soles can be a bit thin.  I notice when I take my dogs on walks & they decide to pull me off the beaten path & I have to walk over rocks or tree branches, you feel it!

For me it was absolutely true the 7.5 fits perfect with room. The shoes are very cute, trendy & soo comfy, so lightweight no wonder they are called cloud they weigh almost nothing. You can also feel the cushiony foam in the insoles.  I got the whitish ones with black they are so bright white & clean & nice looking I love that!
Only 2 cons are super unnecessarily long laces for the style of shoe so when tied they look a bit awky
& also the shoe doesn’t have a tongue since it’s a slip on sock style which makes it difficult to get it on your foot especially for an elderly person or someone that finds that kinda thing difficult with some shoes.
But I know that’s just the style of the shoe & how they are & I like how they look anyway despite that."

I wanted to break them in before making any judgment.  I have to say I love them.... not at first tho.  They are super light weight and the foam soles have a very different feel to what I’m used to.  The tongue / back is higher than  i’m used to and because they are pull ons, this was a bit “rough” at first.  But, after about 1 week of wearing them, they were broken in and I couldn’t imagine wearing other casual shoes.  I have severe rheumatoid arthritis and have had 2 hip replacements along with various other back and shoulder issues- I say this because I cannot speak from the work-out or running perspective.  Walking is my exercise and these are absolutely perfect.  The foam soles are cushioned and feel amazing even after walking all day.

Do I plan on running in these?  No.  In all fairness, I probably wouldn’t run in any shoes (unless I was being chased by a predator or running for the last bar of chocolate on earth).  These shoes were instantly comfortable. I wear a 9-9.5.  The ball part of my foot is med to wide; the heel of my foot is narrow. These work great.  I ordered 9.5 and these are true to size. They have a slight stretch in toe box to accommodate width. I can tied the securely so the heel fits. I love the cushy memory foam. I plan on wearing these at Disney, they are that comfortable.  They look pretty good. If I survive walking 5-10 miles at Disney, I will come back and update my post Disney experience. If I don’t survive, it probably was no fault of these shoes. I’d say one too many ice creams or getting into deadly fight triggered by one too many renditions of “It’s a Small World.”"

But once shoes started getting this kintted / breathable mashing on top my size shrunk down to a comfortable 8 1/2 with plenty of room before  I wear them. There is plenty of room after breaking them in. I love them. I also don’t wear socks. So it gives me more room. This is my second pair of these exact brand differ color. The First pair I have been wearing for six months. And never any socks. They have some how remained  odorless. I’ve washed them twice in the washer with hot water and they are as comfortable and as new looking as the day I bought them. These are great shoes and a must buy for any and everyone."

U cant expect to cross train in this shoe in total comfort. That completely unrealistic and what people actually complained about on here. Second, go a half size smaller. I feel like it supports the foot better. I personally really like the sneakers ive gotten. Im an 8 now since after pregnancy and i got 7.5 and it fits perfect. The intent i have for my sneakers is for walking. Alot of walking but not Disneyland walking or 3 miles a day walking. If i need more support then i would use tri support insoles i usually get. But if i would expect $55 sneakers to have that kind of support they wouldnt be $55 now would they? Be realistic. Common sense is free."

I think because there is no support in these, my arches might have begun to fall because I would literally hobble when I would get out of bed in the morning.  I was chalking it up to being really busy at work, I'm a chef, but I've been busier with no issues.  I bought a different pair of shoes about a month ago.

I haven't bought a pair of running sneakers for over ten years bc I simply didn't like the way they looked.  These, however, are so nice. Just as pictured. The color is a very light pale Gray, and accented with white. They do lace but really slip on. They can be worn with low socks and you don't see the socks at all. They're a casual shoe, not just a running shoe, so they can be worn with cute clothes and still look nice. Not just for running."

They are so lightweight it almost feels like there is nothing on my feet.  The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is when on slightly rocky surfaces, I can feel every single pebble it seems like.  These are probably better for in door exercise or super smooth surfaces.  Otherwise, I really enjoy them.  I ended up buying the same pair in gray as well.  I typically wear a 9 or 9.5 and ended up getting the 9.5 in these.  If you like wearing thick socks, maybe order up a half size."

I really like the look of them and I do think they're comfortable, if a little tricky to put on. They run true to size in my opinion.  I'm a seven in most shoes but a 7.5 in a few brands that run small, like Nike, where I always wear 7.5.  I wore a seven in these and they fit but were slightly snug.

My main reason for returning them was, the memory foam, like, stops about a centimeter from the edge of the toe inside the shoe.  Like, you have memory foam in every part of the shoe except the tip of your toes???  I didn't understand it.  I really want a super comfortable shoe as I will be walking in these a lot at Disney and I immediately knew this would feel weird, but the shoe fit so well that I hesitated to go up to a 7.5, so I just returned them."

Ok, I’m not into sports, so I don’t know if they are good for running, etc. However, I am on my feet all day for my job and these are the most comfortable AND fashionable shoes!!!!! I hate tennis shoes because they always make my foot look so bulky- but not these! They make my foot look small- they have a smaller look to them but with more comfort that any pair I’ve had before. I always have to add comfort insoles to my shoes, but not with these!
They do run large. I had tried them on in-store so I knew which size to buy. I normally wear an 8.5 in tennis shoes, but in these I’m a size 7.5! Big difference if you aren’t expected it. I bought them from Amazon because they were $20 less than in-store.
I’m about to buy a second pair from Amazon in another color! :)
I have literally had a stranger stop me to tell me they loved my shoes and ask about them! Another note- they are actually slip-ons. The laces make them look like typical shoes, and they can tighten them some to adjust for comfort. But you can still slip them on and off with the laces tied without affecting anything. Plus- they don’t stretch out from slipping them on and off! They are designed so well and fit like a glove even though they are slip-ons.
I can’t say enough good things about these shoes!! I don’t have any negative things to add! Get the shoes!!! Maybe try them on at a store for size, but for the price, get them from Amazon!"

The laces are just for show and don’t do that much.  Probably not great for people with wide feet, but mine are narrow so it’s one of the few slip-on shoes that fit.

Buy it!!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I debating getting these sneakers for weeks. I really wanted a slip on sneaker to walk my dog but still wanted decent support. I didn’t realize until they arrived that they are all one piece. The higher back allows for you to hold them while slipping your foot in. The laces are functional in the sense that they can make the shoe tighter if your foot is very narrow but it’s really not needed.

Fit: I usually wear a 7 or 7.5 and bought size 7. They fit perfectly but with no room to spare. A 7.5 would be too large for sure.

Width: These are a very narrow shoe. I’ve included a picture compared to my adidas boost running sneakers.

Function: NOT for running. These are a walking or fashion sneaker. I was surprised after receiving that other reviewers mentioned getting injured after running in these because the minute you take them out of the box you should know they aren’t suitable for that. I walk 3 miles 2-3 times a week and wear these to work pretty often. They work perfectly for that kind of wear but not a high impact activity like running.

Comfort: They are extremely comfortable and very light weight. The fabric is breathable.

Cons: The sole creases in the middle after only a couple wears. They run narrow and might not fit a wider foot. The bottom scuffs away pretty easy and so I think that will be the first part to wear down making them unwearable. I would still buy another pair regardless of these things.

Pros: They look good, feel good and are incredibly functional and versatile. The slip on style is great for people who just don’t want to tie their shoes (you know who you are!) and the branding isn’t in your face slapped all over the shoe.

10/10 would recommend and as soon as I can afford it I’ll be buying a 2nd pair"

I've had these shoes for a few months and I think they're an incredible deal. They're comfy and stylish. Great for everyday wear and exercising. I was worried that the soles wouldn't be supportive enough, but they work great for me (I work out and walk in them every day and run sometimes, but am not a runner--I think serious runners probably should not and would not use these as running shoes). I got these after my physical therapist recommended them--they looked great on her and she wore them to work and said they stayed comfy all day. The one thing to keep in mind is that I think the soles will wear out after a year or so of heavy use--which is normal, especially at this price point. Mine are already starting to wear out, so I could see buying a new pair in about a year. And I will definitely be buying a new pair of the exact same ones!"

I first discovered these at a local shoe store.  I'm normally a size 8 or 8.5 depending on the brand of shoe and the 8's fit me perfectly with thin (or no) socks.  If you wear slightly thicker socks, you may want to go up a half size. I promptly wore these for 3 days straight at Disneyland after only wearing them for about a week prior and had zero blisters!! They were so comfortable! When I got back, I returned to the store to buy the other 2 colors but was disappointed to find out that they did not have my size in stock. Amazon comes through once again! Found the other colors in my size with free Prime shipping. One other thing to note, these are more of a slip on shoe. There are laces but you don't need to undo them to get the shoe on or off.  There is no tongue like a normal shoe so the laces seem more like a decoration. They can tighten the shoe somewhat though if you feel that are too lose."

The heel pulls away slightly from the slope of your ankle, and it keeps it from rubbing a blister!

Like wearing a foamy sock shoe or walking on a cloud.

I bought these to do lightweight training (think weight machines and HIIT workouts in). They are the lightest and softest athletic shoes I’ve ever owned.

That being said, personally, I wouldn’t go outdoor running, hiking or any hard core or intense workouts/sports with these shoes as there’s not much ankle, arch or foot support. Plus the laces of the shoe are just for show versus offering security as it’s truly a slip on shoe. This is where I dinged the 5th star. A true option to be able to adjust the tightness of the laces would be nice.

However, using these shoes on a gym stair climber or elliptical machine? Absolutely. Walking around a city all day or using it as a vacation travel shoe? I can see that. I plan on using these for the latter so I’ll try to update to see how they hold up!"

My toes slide in front of the sole when doing jumps or lunges but that might be due to the stretchy knit upper material and the fact that this is a running shoe. Also slides easily off my heel. I wish they laced up a little closer to my ankles. I’m going to order a 9.5 to see if that works better but only because they are $34.95. As a casual shoe, they are really comfortable and cute. I probably need to get a proper CrossFit shoe, but can’t justify the price just yet."

I have small feet and can generally fit into a lot of shoes but damn these were so uncomfortable and this wasn’t even what upset me. What upset me the most was there should be an “open box” or a “recently worn” label. The shoes came dirty with spills and the bottom of the shoes were worn down- they had no traction, someone had some fun with them before returning. At least check the shoes before reselling them or half price it (if even that) for the condition they came in. Not ok."

I ordered these on Thursday night and they just arrived around 9:30 am on Monday. I read like 40 reviews before buying and nearly everyone said to size down. I am usually all over the place in sizing between an 11 and a 12 for shoes. Like, from Torrid an 11 falls off of me because they think everyone has wide feet and calves, and at Kohl's an 11 women's shoe doesn't even fit halfway up my foot. So, I ordered an 11 because that's the highest size they had and it. fits. perfectly. In the first photo the back of one shoe looks to be gapping but that's because of the way my heel was sitting. They feel lighter than air. If you need a shoe that feels super comfortable on your foot but weighs the amount of a feather, buy these shoes. The second photo is posted to show that they look a little narrow. I personally love this because my feet are on the narrower side. The second I put these on my family member said, ""wow, they really make your feet look smaller!"" here's hoping they hold up well."

I went on Amazon to see if they were cheaper and if they had any other color choices. I chose the black and white carbon ones that weren’t available in the store. I received them today and tried them on. They are much narrower than the ones in the store and with every step I take, I can feel the stitches on the insole where the side of my foot and toe area are. I love the style and color but am going to have to send them back. I guess I will end up with the grey ones and spend more for them at my local store.

  My only issue with them is tying them. There is no tongue, so you slip them on and tie them using the loop at the top. This takes practice if you like them tight on your foot. Not a huge deal, but know they're not like regular ""tie"" shoes."

They only had a size 7, and I normally wear a size 7.5.  The size 7 felt pretty comfortable.  They were a bit snug, but given the style, I knew they would break in.  Let me tell you!  They were the most comfortable shoes I probably ever owned within hours!  They were so comfortable, in fact, that I sought out a deal to buy some in more basic colors.  I have plantar fasciitis and back problems, and these shoes seem to help both.  My feet are pretty average width though.  I can see these not being as comfortable to someone with a wider width.  Though I feel they may even be flexible enough to break in for someone with wider feet.  I do note that the black seem a bit tighter and aren't quite as comfortable to the top of my feet.  That being said, I haven't really tried because I have two other pairs.  But I feel like I should have gone with my normal size in the black."

They can be worn for running, weight lifting, other exercising, or just as everyday shoes; however, I purchased them for everyday wear. I am a college student who walks to class every day. These shoes have been perfect for that. My feet have not hurt one bit. I chose the black and white speckled colored ones to accommodate for comfortable, lazy-day outfits, or cute outfits with jeans! Neutrals are always a go-to in my opinion, because I am definitely one to want to get as much use out of a product as possible. This shoe wipes clean and doesn’t stain which is amazing! I was worried living in Iowa, with heavy snow and rain, that the shoe would be destroyed quite quickly. I was surprised to see how easily they wipe clean.
The Cloudfoam midsole and outsole are combined for step-in comfort and superior cushioning and the sock liner molds to hug the foot as well for extra support. I personally like the high ankle as it gives more stability. The Cloudfoam pure running shoes are super comfortable and lightweight and the fabric is a very breathable mesh. I appreciate that my feet do not sweat when I wear these shoes because of how breathable they are. I love the slick and clean look and that it feels like I am running on air, yet have plenty of support. They are super cute and come exactly as pictured.
The shoes seem to run a half-size big, so I would keep that in mind when purchasing or prepare to wear a little bit of a thicker sock and/or purchase an insole for the shoes. These shoes are more of a slip on shoe. There are laces on the shoe, but there is no tongue, so slipping the shoe on and off can be done quite easily. With that being said, you can pull the laces a little tighter if needed.
I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a good tennis shoe, hence why I rated these shoes four out of five stars! I am quite happy with my purchase and cannot wait to continue to get use out of them."

I just got these Adidas Cloudfoam Pure shoes and they are definitely too small! I wear a standard 7.5 and my toes are all at the top of the shoe. Maybe because of the soft woven fabric and low profile toe trim, it isn’t as noticeable to folks and they think the size is alright. In ANY OTHER athletic shoe or sneaker such as this pair, it would be painful. Not to mention wear out the woven material at my toe are very quickly if I kept them and wore them. I will return them and consider a half-size up; the lack of any arch support whatsoever may be a deal breaker for me between my knees and feet.

I can say that the comfort of the woven portion around your foot is extremely comfortable. Just what I was looking for in a quick slip on sneaker to head on light errands or a very light walk with the dogs in the neighborhood. Pay attention when you order them - they are not intended to be anything more than that... they are not for running or taking out on the trail even for a light day hike!!!

Three stars for comfort and being a lightweight shoe built for light duty (I’d do a 2.5, but don’t have that option). It’ll never get the other two stars due to sizing and lack of arch support... Come on Adidas - you can do much better!

PROS:

• Wide array of color options
• Comfortable woven material on top
• Lightweight
• Cushy foam sole

CONS:

• Runs 1/2 size too small

I have had a red mark for several days now where it rubbed. The tongue is different than what I’m used to because it is attached to the shoe in one piece, not tucked in under the laces, so I couldn’t adjust it at all to stop it from rubbing on my ankle area.

I wear an 8 and bought the same, but I've got a lot of room in the toe box. However, outside of those observations, I'm not entirely sure what Adidas intended on these shoes being worn for. I can't wear them to run because they have absolutely no arch support, they're too soft compared to elite running shoes, and the shoelaces are merely decorative; if I ran in them, they'd most likely slide up and down my heel. I also couldn't wear them to do any kind of lower body weightlifting (squats, deadlifts, any oly lifts, etc.) because despite the shoes being flat and having no support, the sole and insert are very cushioned. I guess if you want a cute pair of shoes to wear to Target or while walking your dog, these are your kicks, but they're absolutely useless in the gym."

I'm so happy! Only got these today, but, after send 2 pairs back...yay! I'm very wide, size 10. I was encouraged to jump up to an 11; those were really huge. These fit perfect. I have a very high arch and these are soft, and comfortable, though, no tounge. It looks like there is, but the whole upper shoes is essentially a loafer. That said, the laces work to cinch the shoe tighter if need be. With my arch there's a bit of a fight to get them on, but not bad. Super light weight. The blue looks more denim than comes off in the pictures. I'm going for a walk!"

On a scale of 1 to 10 regarding style, I would say a 10. On a scale of 1 to 10 on comfort, I would say a 7 (average comfort). The shoe is extremely lightweight and has a thin layer of foam which was hardly noticeable in the ball of the foot. This could be seen as an pro as a light weight shoe for traveling or casual wear.  I bought these hoping for a cushy running shoe, but did not use for running because the padding was so thin on the sole compared to my Nikes and Brooks.  Heel did have padding, but still very light on the padding compared to a traditional “running shoe.” Ball of foot and toe area, little padding.  I run anywhere between 1.5-4 miles 3-5 times per week and will also walk 1-2 miles on other days. The shoe provided more than adequate comfort for walking several miles and did well while walking miles upon miles in Europe. I did not have sore feet! So style was perfect, but comfort for any running activity beyond extensive walking may require a more heavily padded shoe especially if you desire arch support. I did use with arch supports in Europe and found the shoe to be a complete success in meeting my needs for 50miles if walking in 5 days. Again, shoe held up for miles of walking and was comfortable with arch support inserts."

The first month back was awful because I was wearing old work shoes...when I started wearing these shoes I noticed a complete difference and significant decrease in foot pain within only a few days wearing them. They are amazing and now that I have them completely broken in they are literally the best!! My feet don't hurt at all anymore than maybe a slight ache some days. Nothing like before! Must buy.

I just ordered my third pair as they're so comfortable that I tend to wear them everywhere.  Lightweight, breathable, and they fit like a glove.  (they look great too)  They are amazingly durable for the price and minimalist feel, and there is no breaking in period - they are comfortable from day one.  I've always opted for the dark ones, decided to change it up this time, really happy I did!

The only downside I can think of is that they're low profile and the default ""insert"" is in fact part of the shoe - so if you need to wear your own insert, it will likely not fit comfortably in this shoe.  Not a problem for me as I find they provide plenty of support, but should be noted."

Minimal support on the sole so I can only imagine how quickly the material will deteriorate. I read the reviews and everyone said it ran one size big and then some stated it fits true so I decided to order a half size smaller (I usually can toggle between 5.5 and 6 for Women). The 5.5 was still even slightly big. I will still keep it though and just plan on wearing thicker socks. If you look at my
Photos, there’s one with my finger showing how much bigger the shoe was still. I recommend size one down."

Unfortunately, they run a size too big. I was tempted to keep them anyways but there was a large gab in back so they slipped and looked a little silly. I would repurchase in a size smaller but that size is almost $13 more which just takes a all the fun out of shopping. I found them on the adidas site for the same price I paid ($35) in my size so will prob order there but do prefer amazon. As a general note, I love amazon but the price difference between various sizes is pretty off putting. Just a thought for the powers that be-at the very least it would be nice to be able to just exchange if necessary. I am size 6 95% of the time-these just ran very big but I ordered them in good faith so a bit disappointing.
P.S. The only reason these are not 5 star plus is the sizing since it was not even close, at least for me"

I wouldn't have purchased again except they are so comfy and cute and easy to put on. The problem with them is that the soles wear out incredibly quick! I have only had this pair for a month and already they are wearing down. My last pair wore completely through (you could see the fabric of the shoe) in 8 months and I only wear them to walk my dog. Only reason I decided to reorder is I found them on sale for Prime Day. I wouldn't pay full price for these until they fix the issue with the soles.

Order a half size up - I'm normally a 9.5 and I'm a 9 in these."

DO buy a pair in every color when you find them on sale because there isn’t a stinker in the bunch. They’re that cute. You can adjust the shoe with the laces even though these are slip-ons.

I can confidently say that these are not knockoffs. Every minor detail, from the box, to the tag, to the shoe itself, is identical. Even the paper inside the box is the same (imprinted with Adidas logo). Shoe construction is the same, the memory foam insert feels the same to the touch and also when tried on. Knockoffs always cut corners somewhere, whether it be the material, construction, or packing materials (box and paper), and there are no corners cut here. The only slight difference I was able to discern was that the ones from Adidas have a slightly harder and more bright white sole, but the Adidas pair is a year newer per the copyright on the bottom of the box, so it makes sense that the company may have updated the sole slightly to make it more durable from last year’s model.

In my pictures, the Adidas pair is on the left and the Amazon pair is on the right.

Sizing: I am a solid 8.5 with a more narrow foot. Because I have read that Adidas run large, I bought these in an 8. They are not long enough, and they are also not nearly as wide as my Adidas PureBoost sneakers. They are a more narrow cut and fit true to size. Unfortunately, Amazon is currently sold out of 8.5, so I had to return these. I could tell by trying them on that they are VERY comfy, so I will be buying my correct size in the future!"

Silly me, ordered a 7 based on other reviewers saying these shoes run large. They do not: they are pretty true to standard fit. Amazon is wonderful with returns, so I returned and got a 7.5 and they fit great. I advise you to order what you normally do with athletic shoes.

These are good for bopping around town. I do not think they would be good for running as they seem to have very little shock absorption. The sole seems very thin and without much support. I wore these hiking on mountain/forest trails. They didn’t perform all that well—they just were not robust enough. Normally a good pair of running shoes would do well in those conditions.

I recommend them if you are looking for attractive shoes to wear when you need comfort. They do not seem like high performance shoes. That said, they seem a tad overpriced.

All said, they are ok. I like them. I don’t love them."

The cloth of the shoe is very flexible and makes my feet feel warm and cozy like no other tennishoe has ever done.

When I say I've worn them all day and it feels like I'm walking on clouds, they do! I loved them so much I bought a pair for my Mom too! No more walking with my toes crunched up or feeling constricted because the shoe has no flexibility in the toe area (which makes my toes sore). These shoes are flexible and breathable. I give honest to God reviews because I want people to know the real deal before they buy products that I have purchased and this right here is honestly a game changer for the comfort of my feet! It doesn't hurt they they look great too! Outstanding shoe!"

They are built for long and narrow feet. I went up a 1/2 size because I prefer to have sock room and in doing so there is a three finger width length difference and they are way tighter than my normal sized shoes would feel. I know shoes stretch over time but I need to be able to wear them for more than a minute to stretch them.

Theres not enough support for the ball or arch of the foot and they fly knit material lacks the sturdiness that would support the movement and impact the feet experience in running. I wear these for work, I'm a personal trainer and I am on my feet 10-14 hours a day - this is the second pair of these shoes that I have purchased, I walked the bottoms of the first pair almost completely smooth in less than 6 months. These new ones, having had them barely a month are already starting to wear to smooth on the bottom."
